MoT's Automation Week Challenges - Web API



## [The Challenges](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/automation-week-challenges-web-api/43667)
Complete these challenges using any tooling of your choice.

#### Beginner:
Perform a GET request on the branding API and assert the response.

#### Intermediate:
Create a new Room using the Rom API and assert it was successfully created. Tip, you’ll need to also need to prove you are authenticated by calling the Auth API and saving the token!

#### Advanced:
Create a solution/framework that allows you to test all the APIs. You’ll need to include tests for:

* Branding: GET, PUT
* Room: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
* Booking: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
* Auth: POST. Login, logout, validate
* Report: GET
* Messaging: GET, POST,

Bonus, test that you can mark a message as read.
